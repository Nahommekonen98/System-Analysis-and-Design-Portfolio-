# System-Analysis-and-Design-Portfolio-



•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The project was focused on interpreting and creating a system where users could learn about driving through online courses, assessments or through appointments with instructors. The project focuses on providing a resource portal to learn and practice driving and wanted to build a website/system that mainly focused on having customers login to view progress, schedule a driving lesson, and take practice assessment and exams/tests.

•	What did you do particularly well?

The business requirements and the UML documents were clear, concise and well organized. They describe the systems functionality and different entities very well.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to improve the appointment scheduling UML activity diagram. I would have revise the activity diagram to reflect a loop from booking appointment, appointment being denied and taking the user back to schedule another appointment.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

A transcript of the conversation that describes and implements the user’s needs with DriverPass was provided. It is important to understand what the users/client needs In order to provide high quality systems and service.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approached the designing by learning and understanding everything about the user’s needs and the client's requirements before designing the system. In the feature, I would use strategies to analyze and design a system , first by understanding and knowing the whole system to build and design an integrative and proper system and proceeding into diagramming for functionality. I will use UML diagrams/class diagrams in the future to make sure that the system will be clear and easier to understand and design.
